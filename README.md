## Domain of Interest: Car Sales/Gas Prices

3. What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?  
Which months tend to be the best Sales?  
Do the gas prices reflect a balance on the car sales for that month?  
Which brand was most popular within the US, (only have 2019 data, looking for more)?  
Anything with region if we can find that data.  

## Finding Data
1. Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?  
https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_dcus_nus_m.htm  
https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/usa-auto-industry-total-sales-figures/  

2. How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?  
The US Energy Information Administration collected the gasoline price data as monthly and annual averages are simple averages of the weekly data contained therein.  
goodcarbadcar.net compiled data on United States Automotive sales since 2005 broken out by month. This is on a unit basis. This is new vehicle sales in the US since 2005, including passenger cars, commercial vans and light trucks. sourced from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis

3. How many observations (rows) are in your data?  
15 to 30 depending on the amount of years the separate datasets have.  

4. How many features (columns) are in the data?
12, one for each month.  

5. What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?  
All questions should be able to be answered thoroughly with current datasets and will continue to look for more.
